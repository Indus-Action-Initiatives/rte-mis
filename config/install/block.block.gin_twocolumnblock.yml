  title: 'RTE Section 12(1)(c)'
  description: 'In 2009, the Indian Parliament passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, ensuring all Indian children aged six to fourteen access to basic education. Aligned with Article 21A of the Constitution, this act aims to establish a comprehensive educational system. It mandates private unaided schools to allocate a minimum of 25% of their entry-level seats to students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, as specified in Section 12(1)(c). This provision seeks to promote inclusivity and equity in education, facilitating opportunities for marginalized communities to access quality schooling. By enshrining the principle of compulsory education and promoting equal access, the act endeavors to uplift the educational landscape of India, fostering a more equitable and integrated society.'
