            <h2>Lottery Management</h2>


            <p>Lottery Module is one of the significant modules in RTE - MIS. Through this module, applications will
                be allotted to a particular school. Some predefined algorithms should be defined,
                created and followed during the allotment process.


                The process through which the lottery will be performed:
            </p>
            <ol type ="a">
                <li>
                At first, all the applications that are approved are considered for the lottery process. All approved applications are taken up on a pool for the allotment process.
                </li><li>Perform randomization on selected applications; this should have the possibility from the front end that the user can perform randomization more than once.
                </li><li>A random number should be allotted to all the applications, and the allotment process begins based on these random numbers allotted.
                </li><li>In the algorithm, the allotment process starts by taking up the applications individually per the new random number allotted.
                </li><li>During this process, take up the first application from the pool and check for the school selected in the first preference.
                </li><li>Now check for the availability of seats in the first preference school; if a seat is available, the application is marked as allotted to the first preference school; if no, then the application moves to the pending list.
                </li><li>Now, the process checks for the next application from the list and performs the same operation until all applications move to either allotment or pending status.
                </li><li>Once there is no application in the random list, those applications in the pending list are moved for the allotment process for the next preference of school.
                </li><li>Again, randomization should be performed on all the applications and start the allotment process.
                </li><li>Now take up the first application from the random list and check for the availability of the school in the second or next preference. If the application does not have school on the next preference list, then the application will move to the no allotment list. If the application has the school in the next process, perform the next operation.
                </li><li>In case of school availability, the application moves to the next step and checks for the availability of seats in selected schools; if a seat remains, the application will be allotted to that particular school otherwise, the application will move to the pending status.
                </li><li> The same process will repeat until all the application moves to either allotted or no allotment status. Once the pending application list remains zero.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Notes:</b>
            <ol type ="a">
                <li>
                    In the second round of the admission cycle, a lottery will be performed with the approved and no allotment applications, as no allotment applications will get a chance to select new schools where seats are available.
                </li><li>In the second round lottery process, remaining seats will be calculated by including applications in admitted, allotted status. (total RTE seat - admitted - allotted).
                </li><li>During the lottery process, always check for the school status only active schools will participate in the allotment process.
                </li><li>Same applies to checks for aided and minority.
                </li><li>Seat will be checked based on the class medium selected by the applicant.
                </li><li>During the allotment process, the process check for the applicant and school districts should be the same. (In manual mapping, there is a possibility for mis mapping)
                </li><li>Wait list applications will get an option for modification only for the selected schools.
                </li><li>Application number, Student name, Father Name, Nagariya Nikaye and Gram panchayat.
                </li>
            </ol>
           
            <h3>Process for Implementation:</h3>
            <p>
                The lottery module will be implemented separately from the RTE-MIS. There should be an
                option in this module that this should be used separately for any specific State. Reason
                 behind this is that if any state wants to use only the Lottery module from the RTE-MIS,
                  then it should be possible for that State to take up only the lottery module and get
                  the list of allotted applications. For this, we can follow the following process:
            </p>
            <ol type ="a">
                <li>
                    An API integration should be created to take up the list of student applications and the list of schools where the lottery process is to be performed. Another API should be created from the RTE-MIS, and the list of allotted students with their respective schools should be shared with the state.
                </li><li>Ensure that applications should be allotted to their respective schools to which they have selected to be admitted. So, the API from the state should collect a list of students based on preference from their respective selected schools.
                </li><li>Once the API is created and integrated into the Lottery Module, the whole list will move to a temporary table, and lottery operations will perform.
                </li><li>After the allotment process, all allotted applications will be stored on a temporary table. The entire allotted list will be transferred to the States database using an API.
                </li><li>After the data transformation from the lottery module to the State's server, all temporary tables will be deleted, and no records should be stored in the RTE-MIS database.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Validation of Final Lottery</h3>
            <p>The lottery announcement page should be disabled initially and opened after the production data has been validated again.
                <br>
                To validate the data, simply follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ol type ="1">
                <li>Check if the student is allotted in that class only, which he/she has applied during registration.</li>
                <li>Check if a student is allotted in the particular medium, which he/she has selected during registration.</li>
                <li>Check for extra or over-allotment by validating the total number of seats the school provides and the number of students allotted in that particular school. This should be done class-wise in every individual school.</li>
                <li>Check that the student is allotted as per the preference given and to the nearest school as provided.</li>
                <li>Check at the time of allotment application school should be in active status. At the time the lottery should check for school active status.</li>
                <li>Check for the District as well, the applicant district and selected school should be from the same district. (This should properly work in neighborhood mapping section of school module)</li>
                <li>School preference should not be set for the same for two schools or the same school but different mediums. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                After successfully validating the lottery on the main/production website, the lottery announcement page should be visible to public users.
                Hence, the lottery process is now completed.
