Some fields are dynamic in nature which differ for different states, some fields are static which are once deployed on form then do not need modifications and there is a predefined logic to display the list of eligible list of schools to particular applicants.

            <p>While applicants fill out the application form, they need to select schools for getting admission over there. Applicants need to add a preference of schools to which they want to get admitted. </p>
            <ol type ="a">
                <li>A list of schools will be displayed based on the current location selected (Habitation), the age of the student, and the gender of the student.</li>

                <li>Then based on the age criteria entered, again make a filter on selected schools, shortlist only those schools who have declared entry class on which applicant is eligible to get admission.</li>
                <li>Now based on the gender selected for applicants, one more level of filter is applied to selected schools, like if the selected gender is Boy then girl's schools should not display, if the selected gender is Girl then boy's schools should not display, and if selected gender is Transgender then all selected schools will display. </li>
                <li>Once the list of schools is displayed (after applying all the above filtration), there should be a column which is to select the preference and set priority to the schools to get admission. </li>
                <li>To set the preference there should be a dropdown list, which should be filled with numbers that contain the maximum number of schools displayed on the form.</li>

                <li>If school runs in two mediums, in that situation school should display two times for two different mediums, and it should be parents' choice to apply for both mediums or any one.</li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>  
            <b>Notes: </b>
            <ol>
                <li>By following this validation, we can reduce the opportunities to the choice center, school admins and other persons to add their own number on the application form other than parents mobile number. </li>
                <li>Also while adding the student and parents basic information and press on the next button, then check for the duplicacy of application, if it exists then ask them to make modification on existing application.</li>
                <li>To check duplicate applications check the combination of student name, student DOB, parent name and parents Aadhar number (take last 4 digits only).</li>
                <li>DOB will check on 31st March of every year. Applicants should complete 3 yrs till 31st March to apply and less than 6.5 years. ( Configurable by the state )</li>
                <li>Log should maintain for applications status changed and display on application status view.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Student Application Print</h3>
            <p>
                At the end of application submission / modification there should be an option to get a printout of the application. There should be two ways to get an application printed, one is immediately just after the application submission automatically print form should display either in pop up or by providing print option. Second one is there should be a menu from where users can get print out of their field application whenever they require.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get print out of the application applicant needs to enter the application number in the search field and click on the view button. After clicking the view button a filled application form will display and an option to take printout of the application should display. From where users can take print out of the application for their further reference.
            </p>

            <h3>Student Application Modification</h3>
            <p>Applicants can do the modification on the application by having the OTP verification of registered mobile numbers.</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>If applicants want to make any modification on an existing application then they firstly need to enter their registered mobile number and through the OTP they validate the mobile number.</li>
                <li>If the mobile number is validated then the applicant can see the list of applications which are registered with the same mobile number (that may be one or more then one).</li>
                <li>Now from the application list parents can select the application id on which they want to make changes.</li>
                <li>Once the applicant clicks on the application ID, then the whole application will open in the edit format and the applicant can change all information in the application.</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Notes:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>If applicants make changes in any of these information Location details, DOB, gender of student, then selection of school should be clear and the applicant needs to reselect the schools with the preference.</li>
                <li>In the case of the second round of application, the status of the application should not be changed if any applicants do the modifications.</li>
                <li>Allotted applications and after allotment changed status applications like admitted, did not come to school and dropout applications can not make further changes on application, they will not be considered in the current academic year.</li>
                <li>If the application is in verified status and allotment is not done, then applicants can make modifications only on the school selection tab, other tabs are blocked for them, and in this situation Status of the application remains the same.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Student Application Verification</h3>
            <p>Once the application is submitted and parents physically provide the documents including application hard copy. Then the role of block admin will start. Block admin needs to verify the application and all necessary documents and then update the status on the portal.</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>To update application status on the portal, block admin should have a panel from where a block admin can see the list of applications which they received under their block.</li>
                <li>In this panel block admin can see the whole list of applications which they received.</li>
