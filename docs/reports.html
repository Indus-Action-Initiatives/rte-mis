                    <b>Master Report</b> 
                    <br/>This feature allows users to generate customized reports based on specific filter options. Users can create their queries by selecting options from dropdown filters and exporting reports in formats like PDF or Excel. This report will minimize the level of coding as it allows users to extract various types of reports per their needs. This documentation will guide you through creating and extracting custom reports.
                    <br/>There will be some key features like:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Custom Date Ranges: Users can filter data based on custom date ranges for fields such as admission dates, performance reviews, or project deadlines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Multiple Selection: Users can select multiple values within a filter (e.g., multiple classes, multiple locations) to create broader queries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Location: Choose a specific district or block filters for specific results.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Status: Select statuses like <b>Completed, In Progress, or Pending.</b>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    By using the combination of the above, the user can get the required reports. That can reduce the number of reports that may be helpful to get customized reports as per their requirements.
