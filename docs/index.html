## Introduction

Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 mandates that 25% of seats in class 1 in every private school across India must be reserved for students belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker sections in the neighborhood of the school and that they must be taught for free. The scheme also directs the ariate state government to reimburse the cost incurred per student by the private school for every academic year.

The scheme is generally implemented every academic year (also called “campaign year”) through registering private schools for the campaign, inviting applications from parents/guardians, allotting the students to available seats according to eligibility and reservation criteria through a lottery process, getting the applicants admitted to the allotted schools, monitoring student performance during the year, and finally reimbursing the school.

The Act also allows state governments to form their own rules in implementing the scheme by allowing more classes to be covered under the scheme, adding further criteria and conditions for reservation under the scheme, setting up its online system, and scheduling its admission cycle. 
However, implementation of this scheme has been sparse with almost 11 states not implementing it till now and some states not having any online system to support its implementation. Along with this, there is the challenge of selecting students out of the large pool of candidates being eligible.
This is where the applicability of an online application comes in.
