            <h1 class="mb-4">RTE MIS Product Documentation</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>RTE - MIS is a web-based application for managing the end-to-end implementation of the social welfare policy contained in Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 by any state government in India.</p>
            <p>RTE - MIS goal is to ensure the availability of Section 12(1)(c) in all States and to ensure the welfare unlock for all deserving children. The Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 mandates that 25% of seats in class 1 in every private school across India must be reserved for students belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker sections in the neighborhood of the school and that they must be taught for free. The scheme also directs the appropriate state government to reimburse the cost incurred per student by the private school for every academic year.
            </p>
            <p>RTE - MIS consists of 9 different modules. These modules are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Public Pages</li>
                    <li>App Administration</li>
                    <li>School Module</li>
                    <li>State Module</li>
                    <li>Student Module</li>
                    <li>Lottery Module</li>
                    <li>Admission Module</li>
                    <li>Student Tracking Module</li>
                    <li>Reimbursement Module</li>
                    <li>Grievance Module</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>The app core module acts as a foundation for the application. The other modules extend the foundation.</p>

            <h3>1. Public Pages</h3>
		    <p>Public page modules consist of the pages or screens which do not require any login authentication, and also the pages which should be easily accessible to the stakeholders. This module mainly holds general information about the scheme, the process to apply, application pages, basic reports that are required for application, and a page for raising grievances. Time-to-time notifications are displayed on this module.</p>

            <p>The app administrator will manage the content of these pages using a content management system present in the app. Certain content is likely to change during the period of scheme implementation such as notifications, press releases, documents, instructions, and such. Therefore, a content management system is essential.</p>

            <h3><a href="appadmin.html">2. App Administration</a></h3>

            <p>The app admin module is concerned with all features required for the administration of the application by the user who can be considered as super administrator of the application. It is the app administrator's responsibility to configure the application to suit the needs of the state government.</p>

            <p>The app administrator will be responsible for user management, creating the account for State administration, defining permissions and privileges for different user roles, and content management.</p>

            <h3><a href="school.html">3. School Module</a></h3>
            <p>In School Modules school administrations enroll themselves for specific academic cycles. To participate in the RTE scheme a private school must have an account in the MIS portal. Once the account is created, the school can register itself. Further from the preceding years, schools need to modify their existing information.</p>

            <p>In this module school administrators provide schools information which are required for participating in the scheme. Information like - location information, recognition information, seat information, entry class information, fees information, CWSN availability information, bank account details etc.</p>

            <p>Once the registration process is completed, the government authority performs the verification and makes necessary mapping operations to the verified school.</p>

            <h3><a href="state.html">4. State Management</a></h3>
            <p>In the State module, the state admin has the power to manage the roles of the other government authorities and their rights, schedule the campaign cycle, trigger different rounds of lottery, send SMS to allotted students, and perform the reimbursement process to the beneficiaries' (schools) accounts.</p>

            <h3><a href="student.html">5. Student Module</a></h3>
            <p>In this module applicants who wish to participate in the RTE scheme and want to get benefit of this scheme, will apply and participate in it by filling the application form. Applicants need to provide their information on the application form and submit the hard copy of the filled application to the respective government authorities.</p>

            <p>After the application submission, government authorities perform the verification process of the application and make the changes in the application status as per the document received. Once the verification process completes the process moves to the next stage that is triggering the lottery.</p>

            <h3><a href="lottery.html">6. Lottery Module</a></h3>
            <p>The lottery module primarily concerns the lottery algorithm (for filtering and allotting applicants to available seats) and the feature to execute the algorithm against the applicant data.</p>

            <p>The lottery process essentially involves applying a set of conditions described by the government in the initial notification and allotting applicant children/students to available seats. States have the freedom to add categories, two major categories were applied that are Disadvantaged Groups and Weaker Sections. Distance is another criteria that applies in the lottery process. States have the right to define the distance criteria for their specific state.</p>
            
            <h3><a href="admission.html">6. Admission Module</a></h3>
            <p>In the admission module, schools will be able to see the list of students who are allotted to their school and can perform the necessary actions on the applications. School admins play a major role in this module; they need to mark the student as admitted, not admitted, or in dropout status based on their actual admission to the school. Using these statuses, schools update the performance of admitted students and also make claims for all admitted students. </p>

            <h3>8. Student Tracking Module</h3>
            <p>The student tracking feature enables schools to track school attendance, and performance of students admitted/retained under the RTE 12(1)(c) scheme. Updating student performance details is a year-long process and the school admins should have the facility within the school admin panel to regularly update them.</p>
            
            <p>Student attendance and performance are tracked primarily to verify reimbursement claims from schools and also monitor the impact of the RTE 12(1)(c) scheme itself.</p>

            <h3>9. Reimbursement Module</h3>
            <p>This module is concerned with the reimbursement of fees to the participating private schools by the state government. In this module school administration makes reimbursement claims, verification of claims performed by preceding government authorities, and processing of claims made by state authority using a specified payment gateway.</p>

            <p>This module also tracks the status of reimbursements due to schools in lieu of tuition & other expenses incurred by the school on behalf of all children admitted under the provision.</p>
            
            <h3>10. Grievance Module</h3>
            <p>This module is concerned with the handling and processing of grievances raised by participating schools and parents of the students to government officials. Government officials handle all grievances and after resolution of grievances update the status on the portal using this module.</p>

            <p>Grievances can be raised by the parents/guardians, schools, blocks, and districts that can be raised either to their immediate authorities or directly to the State authorities.  All the officers will take necessary action (offline) and update the resolution status online.</p>

            <h3>11. Additional Creations</h3>
            <p>In this part, the additional background required setups will happen. Some sections need to be created as a basic setup like Multilingual features, Integration of SMS and Email integration, etc.</p>
