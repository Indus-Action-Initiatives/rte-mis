            <h2>School Management Module</h2>
		The School Management Module is created for the school administration to enable them to participate in a particular academic cycle. During 		the implementation of this module, there are multiple small stories created in Jira and implementation has been made accordingly.
<ol>
	<li>
	<b>School account creation</b><br/>
		<ol type ="a"><li>
		School person visits the RTE portal and clicks on the school account creation tab and enters the UDISE code.
		</li><li>
		System checks for the validity of entered Udise code -
			<ol><li>
				In first step checks entered Udise code is belongs to an existing school in RTE portal db, and its status is not BULKUPLOAD 				or INDIVIDUAL (this may be approved, reject or any other) If yes, then throws an error that an account for school with 					entered UDISE is already exists, and notify that user can reset their credentials using forgot password tab.
			</li>
			<li>
			If status is BULKUPLOAD or INDIVIDUAL then, the school moves to the next step and enters other information which 					are: 
				<ul><li>
				Mobile number</li><li>
				Email ID</li><li>
				District</li><li>
				Block</li><li>
				U/R </li></ul>
			</li>
			</ol>
		<li>
			After entering the above information, validate the Mobile number and Email ID through the OTP validations. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the validation is done then the school can submit the details and an account will be created.
		</li>
		<li>
			Once the account is created then the school will be able to do the campaign registration. 
		</li>
		</ol>
			Note- Till the campaign registration is not approved, school should be in block status.<br/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>School Registration</b><br/>
		<ol type ="a">
		<li>
		Once email and mobile number are verified, then school moves to the next step for the registration process and proceeds with the below process. If the email address and/ or mobile number is not verified then the registration process will stop or rollback with the notification that “Without verification of email and mobile number school can not part in the registration process”.
		</li>

	</ol><br/>
	Once the form is filled with the above information,then after accepting the declaration. school submits the form. When applications get submitted at that time an unique id will be generated that should be the combination of udise code and school name.
	<br/>
	Note - At the time of renewal or at the time of new recognition some time District authority assign the new udise code to school, that may be new udise code or may be the udise code of any closed schools, in this situation addition of new school to the RTE portal will become difficult because that udise code is already existing in RTE portal for any other school.
	<br>
	After the successful completion of registration. School administration needs to print the application, with the seal sign of school administration, and with all other required documents they need to submit this to their higher authority (That is mostly BEO) for approval process.
	<br/><br/>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<b>School Registration modification</b><br/>
	<ol type = "a"><li>
	School logs into the account and clicks on a Profile (View/Modify) menu to update registration information for the new academic year.
	</li><li>
	Once the school finishes updating the information and submits the details, the system marks the registration status of the school as “Registered” and then the same process of school verification and approval process is followed from this point.
	</li><li>
	For the verification process the school admin takes print of application form and along with all necessary documents and needs to submit these documents to the dedicated BEO.
	</li></ol>
	</li>
	<br/>
	<li>
		<b>School Registration print</b><br/>
		<ol type = "a"><li>
		From this section, schools should be able to take printouts of their registration information’s printout at any point of time whenever they require. 
		</li><li>
		To take printout of registered information by log in to their account and by click on the profile menu and click on print button. 
		</li></ol>
	</li>
	<br/>
	<li>
	<b>School Registration verification</b><br/>
	State can follow one level of verification or two level of verification, process are as follow:
	<ol type = "a"><li>
	IF State chooses the two levels of verification, in that situation a block level officer 
	completes the verification process (offline), and then officer must change the status of the 
	school from “Applied” to “Verified” with some remarks. If during the verification process it 
	was found that the school is not eligible for participating in the campaign, the officer will 
	write reason on remarks and will change the status of the school to “Rejected”.
	</li><li>
	The district level officer should be able to see the list of schools marked as “Verified” by 
	the block level officer. If the district officer is satisfied the officer will change the 
	status of the school to “Approved”.
	</li><li>
		Once the District level officer is marked as” Approved”, at that moment the school admin
		 will get the access to all necessary modules for which school is eligible for.
	</li><li>
		In other way, if the State takes decision for one level verification, then BEO will make 
		the verifications as shared in point A and directly “Approve” the registration and 
		immediately school will get the access  to all necessary modules for which school is 
		eligible for.
	</li></ol>
	</li>
	<br/>
	<li>
		<b>Notes / Configurable parts</b><br/>
	<ol><li>
	Level of school registration verification should be configurable, either two levels (BEO →DEO) 
	or one (BEO or DEO). Need to set up the access rights on the basis of approval.
	</li><li>
	Schools will get SMS notifications of status getting changed. This should be configurable at 
	the State level, whether they want to have SMS notification or not.
	<li>
	This should be the decision of the state that they want to open the registration / modification 
	/ renewal process and verification process together  or separately. This can be managed by a 
	campaign creation page ( no configurable pages are required).
	</li>
	<li>
	If this is not opening together in that situation, there should be a school registration 
	modification page required at the level of BEO, from where BEOs can make necessary changes 
	and mark applications directly to the “Approved” status.
	</li>
	<li>
	If State follows two levels of verification, in that situation if DEOs want to get some 
	modification on school registration then school can reach to BEO and after getting necessary 
	changes school can get their registration to be approved. 
	</li>
	</li></ol>
	</li>
	<br/>
	<li>
		<b>RTE seat Declaration logic</b><br/>
		There are certain cases for declaring the entry class or classes. This should be the configurable section for the State administration. In all cases Class -1 should be mandatory.
		<ol type ="a"><li>
		Dual entry class - In dual entry classes, class -1 will be in the form of a mandatory class, and another will be either Nursery (LKG) or KG-1 (UKG). 
		<ul><li>
		This should not be mandatory for all schools to have dual entry class, schools can have either only the class - 1 as entry class or with the class - 1 can have any one from the pre- primary classes.
		</li><li>
		While School is going for dual entry classes then certain backend calculations should be performed  to make the division of % correctly.
		</li><li>
		In case of dual Classes, while entering the total seats information for class - 1 then below calculation should performed - (Total seat of class 1) - (Total seat of pre- primary) as Remaining Total seat for class - 1, and then State specified percentage will be taken to declare as Total RTE seat for class - 1.
		</li><li>
		If after performing above calculation, class -1 seat comes 0 or less then 0, in that case declare the RTE seat for class - 1 to 0 (Zero). Or remove the class -1 from entry class.
		</li><li>
		And in case the school wants to remove pre- primary from entry class then this is up to the school, they can make modifications on their registered information via profile update section.
		</li></ul>
	<li>
		Single Entry Class - In single entry class, only class -1 will be declared as the entry class for all schools. 
	</li></ol>
